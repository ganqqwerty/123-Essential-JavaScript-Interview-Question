	/**
	 * I first met Nishant 3 months ago when I told him I was looking for help with
	 * AngularJS and asked him to mentor me. One of the first things I noticed was that
		 * he had a great learning attitude, because he told me that he was looking forward
		 * to learning from me, something I wasnâ€™t expecting from a mentor! He is fun,
		 * sweet, generous and has a great sense of humor. We have quickly become friends
	 * and I think we have spent more time hanging out on Telegram (instant messaging)
	 * and Skype than we have coding. I had never written my own AngularJS directive
	   * before so I asked him if he could write one for me for an autocomplete feature.
	 * I was impressed with his work and because of it I was then able to write my own
	 * directives. We have spent a lot of time chatting and I think there is so much
	 * more he can do that I have not yet seen. I can see he also has a passion for
	 * startups.
